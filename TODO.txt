dataset: 
learn about dataset, which features are continious/categorical, distribution, correlation - nadezda

feature processing:
cleaning, combining, better represenations, scaling - stefan, after dataset is finished
imputation (median nesho simple ili pokompleksno kako optional - MICE/KNN)


submit a baseline
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- meet to discuss further work


model:
determining whether a model underfits or overfits, visualizing, wrongly classified datapoints(why is this the case) -> improve model

accurately estimate with cross-validation how the model is doing. Which changes had the largest impact on the outcome (preprocessing, feat eng etc.)

report:
strict limit of 2 pages

reproducibility!!!
complete information about which values we tried (lambda, params...)
by how much do changes increase/decrease result, use baseline algorithms!
